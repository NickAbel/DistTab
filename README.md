## About

DistTab is a library being developed for use with combustion codes that use spray flame lookup tables. Currently, simulations across multiple NUMA nodes store the entire flame lookup table on each node, which limits the size of the lookup table. DistTab distributes the lookup table across nodes, partitions the table in a logical manner and uses MPI one-sided communication to retrieve lookup table values and stores the partitions containing the lookup values on the local node using a FIFO queue.

## Functionality

* Lookup table storage
  * Loading/reading in table
  * Reorganizing table into partitions based on locality in thermochemical state space
* MPI get values from other nodes
  * Based on partition, stored in FIFO queue locally
* And more...

## Prerequisites

* Fortran compiler, such as gfortran
* MPI library, such as OpenMPI

### Install

To compile and run the tests

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/NickAbel/DistTab.git
$ cd DistTab
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ cd ../bin
$ ./disttab
```
